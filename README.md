# CodeEvaluation
Basic Code Evaluation programs 

1. SumOf2Numbers - Pass 2 ints as parameter and return the sum of numbers.

2. OddOrEvenNumbers - Check the given number is odd or even, the definitionof an "even" number is that the number is divisible by "2" without a remainder. Mathematicians would write an even number E=(2xN).Then E is always divisible by "2".The definition applies to all integers, +ve and -ve including 0.

3. Pass an int as parameter, test whether the number is divisible by 7 or not.

4. Return true if the given non-negative number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 5. Use % operator.

5. Given 2 Strings, append them together and return the result.
